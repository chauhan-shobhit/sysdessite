The Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) is transforming manufacturing. Central to this transformation is the concept of the **Digital Twin**: a dynamic, virtual representation of a physical asset, process, or system. In a manufacturing context, a Digital Twin platform integrates real-time data from the factory floor with physics-based models, simulation capabilities, and data analytics to provide unprecedented insights, optimize operations, predict failures, and enable smarter decision-making.
